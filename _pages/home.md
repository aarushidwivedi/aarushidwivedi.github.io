## About
<small> I am currently pursuing Master's degree in Cybersecurity at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). With a strong passion for security, I have gained valuable knowledge and hands-on experience in various security domains during my academic and professional experiences. I am also a Head Graduate Teaching Assistant here for [Applied Cryptography Course](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6260-applied-cryptography/) (CS 6260).</small>

<small> This summer I interned at [CSX Technology](https://www.csx.com/) in their Security Infrastructre Team. As part of the company's efforts to enhance its cloud security posture, I led a proof of concept initiative using Agile methodology. This involved close collaboration with the GRC team, with whom I worked on daily threat intelligence exercises, threat modeling, access control, and security governance. To bolster the company's defenses, I evaluated and deployed Microsoft Defender for cloud and gained proficiency in working with cloud platforms such as Azure, GCP, and AWS. Please head over to my [resume](/resume) or [projects](/projects) to know more about my work. </small>

## Interests

<small> A security enthusiast who loves to keep up with the latest cybersecurity trends and techniques. I also enjoy dancing, and  find comfort in binge-watching TV shows and movies. I believe that a healthy work-life balance is essential for a fulfilling life, and enjoys indulging in my hobbies such as playing chess and badminton to keep my mind and body refreshed. </small>

<small> Currently, I am preparing for my OSCP certifcation. </small>
